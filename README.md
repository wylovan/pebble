If you're in a hurry, you can get Pebble and up running in a couple of minutes by following these steps.

 1. Take the pebble.war file from the distribution and deploy it, by copying it to $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps.
 2. Restart Tomcat and point your browser to http://localhost:8080/pebble/.
 3. Start blogging by logging in with the default username/password combination of username/password.

For further installation details, please see docs/installation.html in the distribution.
